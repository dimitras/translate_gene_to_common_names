Translate protein names(gene names, protein accnos, part of the protein description) to common names.

Searched eiconsanoid pathway proteins from publication (http://www.mcponline.org/content/early/2012/02/23/mcp.M111.014746) through mouse proteome from uniprot fasta file (release 2012 and not 2009) to generate a list with protein and common names.

NOTE: there may be some genes not translated... in tha case search in the uniprot for the also known names, and search them through mouse proteome, if they are in there, replcae them throught the names list and translate again.
